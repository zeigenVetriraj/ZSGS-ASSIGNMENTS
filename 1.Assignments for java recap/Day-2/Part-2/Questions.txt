Day-2 Assignment Questions: Part-2 Arrays

1. Write a program that creates an integer array of 10 elements, accepts values of arrays and Find the sum of all odd numbers.
2. Write a program to take in 10 values and print only those numbers which are prime.
3. Write a program which generates 30 terms of Fibonacci no in an array and then prints it.
4. Design a function void print( ) with a single dimensional array x[ ] and n (as size of the array) as function arguments. The function calculates sum of only single digit and sum of only double digit elements from the array. Design a main() function to input size of the array ‘len' and single dimensional array of size 'len', and print the required result by invoking the function print( ).
5. Write a program to initialize the following character arrays and print a suitable message after checking the arrays whether the two arrays are identical or not. Make suitable use of Boolean data type. X[] =('m', 'n', 'o', 'p'} and Y[] =('m', 'n', 'o', 'p' }
X[] =('m', 'n', 'o', 'p'} and
Y[] =('m', 'n', 'o', 'p' }
6. Write a program to accept the year of graduation from school as an integer value from the users . Using the Binary search technique on the sorted array of integers given below . Output the message “record exists" if the value input is located in the array and if not output the message record does not exits”.
